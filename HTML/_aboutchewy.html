    <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Chewy the Lizard</u>. I am 17 years old and I am a software engineer that lives in Texas. In my spare time, I enjoy video games, watching Netflix, and studying Java script.</p>
    <p>The other day I discovered how to cook the perfect steak. Essentially, you need to season it with salt and pepper, then baste it with garlic, butter and thyme. Personally, I quite like my steaks rare.</p>
